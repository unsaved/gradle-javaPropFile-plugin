Important information for users upgrading JavaPropFile
    
GOTCHAS
    * Version 1.0.0 and later require Gradle 2.0 or later.
    * Version 0.6.0 requires Gradle 1.2 or later.
    * Version 0.4.* and 0.5.* require Gradle 1.0-milestone-6 or later.
      (This is due to compatibility-killing Groovy upgrade in Gradle).
    * If you upgrade gradle to milestone-6, completely wipe out your Gradle
      cache at $HOME/.gradle.  Nasty, confusing problems may result if you do
      not.  This has nothing to do with JavaPropFile, but with Gradle caching.
